Revamped c# .net core 6 RESTFUL api with user authentication.

Documentation To Come

This project has been abandoned. It was based off of the asp net core 5 series from nick chapsas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdlt3-ptt9g&list=PLUOequmGnXxOgmSDWU7Tl6iQTsOtyjtwU&index=2 which i tried to update for dotnet core 6. After progressing I found this series to be outdated and ineffective. A good amount was updated but the design pattern I cannot agree with. People can give me a hard time all they want for using a repository with ef core but even microsoft recommends it. There is another project called BookLibraryAPI which will be a proper rehaul using repository pattern and more additions.
